            <p>22. Users agree that due to the instability of information technology and occasional errors in manual operations, if the Platform inadvertently makes a major mistake in pricing the published commodities and conducts wrong pricing that is obviously unfair (such as pricing the product significantly lower than one-third of the market sales price without special explanation), it shall be regarded as a major mistake of the Platform. If a user places an order and transacts due to a major misunderstanding, regardless of the quantity, the Platform has the right to directly terminate the transaction and refuse to deliver the goods once the problem is found and before delivering to any user.</p>
        </li>

The evaluation content shall be legal, objective, true, relevant to the traded goods and/or services, and shall not contain any obscene language, pornographic and vulgar content, advertising information, and other prohibited information specified in laws and regulations and this Agreement; you shall not help others improve their credit in improper ways or use the right to evaluate to threaten or extort other users. SportFree may take measures such as deleting information and restricting account rights for the evaluation information generated by your aforementioned acts in accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement and the SportFree rules.</p>
        </li>

You confirm and agree that the aforementioned management measures shall also apply to your associated accounts.</p>

        <li>
            <p>27. If your acts cause losses to SportFree and/or its affiliated companies (including direct economic losses of their own, losses of goodwill, and indirect economic losses such as compensation, settlement payments, attorney fees, litigation fees paid to external parties), you shall compensate SportFree and/or its affiliated companies for all the above losses; if your acts cause SportFree and/or its affiliated companies to be claimed by a third party, SportFree and/or its affiliated companies may recover all losses from you after assuming obligations such as monetary payment to the third party; if a third party suffers losses due to your acts, SportFree and/or its affiliated companies may deduct the corresponding amount from any of your SportFree accounts for payment for the purpose of protecting social public interests or consumers' rights and interests.</p>
